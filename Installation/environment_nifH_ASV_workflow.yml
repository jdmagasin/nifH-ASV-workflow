## This file describes packages required to run the nifH ASV workflow.
##
## Maintainer notes:
## This yml must mirror the DADA nifH pipeline's environment_DADA2_nifH_with_ancillary.yml, and add
## the few additional workflow-specific packages in the final section. Mirroring is not ideal but is
## safer/simpler for the user compared to cloning DADA2_nifH and adding each new pacakge.
## Note also that an earlier solution was to --stack nifH_ASV_workflow on top of
## DADA2_nifH. However, that only works for conda packages.  R and python libraries installed in
## DADA2_nifH would disappear if there was an R or python in nifH_ASV_workflow (and my workaround,
## adding them to DADA2_nifH, was a hack).
